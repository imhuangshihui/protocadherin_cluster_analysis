# DNA methylation-based measures of cognitive decline over 16 years with Protocadherins (Pcdhs)

## Background

Protocadherins (Pcdhs) are a group of cell-cell adhesion molecules that are highly expressed in the nervous system and have a major function in dendrite development and neural circuit formation. Epigenetic dysregulation of different protocadherins, in particular clustered PCDHs has been observed in a variety of different disorders that are directly or indirectly influencing brain structure and function. Here, we analysed the methylation changes of clustered PCHDs during aging between cognitive decliners (N=24) and cognitive mainders (N=23) by using Illumina HumanMethylationEPIC arrays. In total, 876 CpG sites related to PCDHs clusters were selected by their position in UCSC genome browser.
