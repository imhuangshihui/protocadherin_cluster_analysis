# DNA methylation-based measures of cognitive decline over 16 years with Protocadherins (Pcdhs)

## Background

Protocadherins (Pcdhs) are a group of cell-cell adhesion molecules that are highly expressed in the nervous system and have a major function in dendrite development and neural circuit formation. DNA methylation-based (DNAm) measures of biological aging associate with increased risk of morbidity and mortality, but their links with cognitive decline are less established.
